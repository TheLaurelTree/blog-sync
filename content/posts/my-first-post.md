## Introduction

This is **bold** text, and this is *emphasized* text.

The syntax used here is called `Markdown`, and enables rapid generation of written content for web-based distribution and more -- especially blog content.

### Lists

Key syntax features make use of ordered and unordered list structures as follows.

#### Unordered

- unordered item 1
- unordered item 2
  - unordered item 2.1
  - and 2.2
- unordered item 3

#### Ordered

1. ordered item 1
1. ordered item 2
   1. ordered item 2.1
   1. and 2.2
1. ordered item 3

### Tables

Tables are also allowed using a simple syntax.

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

> NOTE: The spacing used is not required

### Definitions

Terms can also be defined.

First Term
: This is the definition of the first term.

Second Term
